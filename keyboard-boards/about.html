  <h2>A cover that earns its place.</h2>
    <p class="hero-description">
    The Keyboard Board is a space-saving cover designed for musicians who want a cleaner setup without adding more furniture.
    It turns the top of your keyboard into a stable, usable surface while keeping the look intentional: simple, elegant, and built to last.
    Whether you're working in a bedroom studio, a rehearsal corner, or a tight apartment, it creates room for what you actually need:
    notes, a laptop, a coffee, or a moment of calm before you play.
    </p>
  
  <p class="hero-description">
    Materials are selected for strength, finish, and character; because this is a functional object that still has to feel beautiful.
    The goal is straightforward: reduce clutter, save space, and make your keyboard feel like part of the room. Not something you have to work around.
